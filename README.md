# OSRS World Population Tracker
Tool to track the population of the old school runescape worlds

Should work in all python 3 versions

This program gets the html sheet of the world select page and extracts the population numbers every minute, then shows how the population has fluctuated in the last minute.

Left number of each set is the world number, right number is change in population since last scan. The first scan will just show current population instead. If a pop is listed as n/a then the world is either down or the pop isnt being displayed by jagex for some reason.
